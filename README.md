This "White paper" will help you understand the difficulties and simplify designing the cylinders for plunger valves. Discharge coefficients for flow through different multi-hole cylinders will be evaluated.

The calculations is based on the similarity of the control cylinders to the orifice plates. The model will be limited to turbulent flow models to predict velocities, pressure drop, cylinder discharge coefficient, and flow characteristics.

This document also presents a mathematical model for designing perforated cylinders that allow installed linear flow characteristics.

Later it will be necessary to carry out tests under laboratory conditions. The experimental results must be compared and analyzed to optimize the proposed models.
